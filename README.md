## Project Overview

This project analyzes employee data from IBM to uncover key factors influencing employee attrition, satisfaction, and performance. By exploring attributes such as job role, satisfaction levels, compensation, and work-life balance, the project provides insights to help organizations reduce employee turnover and enhance workforce performance.

## Objectives

1. Clean and preprocess the raw HR dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in employee attrition.
3. Investigate relationships between attrition and factors such as job satisfaction, overtime, and years at the company.
4. Create visualizations to clearly communicate key findings.
5. Generate actionable recommendations to help HR departments retain top talent and improve employee satisfaction.

## Technologies Used

- Excel  
- Power BI  
- Power Query


## Data Source

The dataset used for this project is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) and includes information on 1,470 employees, covering:

- **Demographics:** Age, Gender, Marital Status, Education  
- **Job Details:** Department, Job Role, Job Level, Years at Company  
- **Satisfaction & Performance:** Job Satisfaction, Environment Satisfaction, Performance Rating  
- **Compensation:** Monthly Income, Stock Option Level, Overtime  
- **Other Factors:** Business Travel, Work-Life Balance, Training Times  

## Data Cleaning

To ensure reliable analysis, the dataset underwent extensive cleaning and validation:

- Converted encoded columns (e.g., Education, Satisfaction levels) to descriptive labels.  
- Removed irrelevant columns with constant values.  
- Detected and removed employees with logical inconsistencies (e.g., impossible work histories, unrealistic promotion records).  
- Verified age ranges (18 to 60) and ensured no duplicate employee IDs.  
- Created new features such as attrition rates, high-risk employee flags, and overtime-related metrics.  

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA explored:

- **Attrition Rates:** By department, job role, and overtime status.  
- **Satisfaction Patterns:** Impact of job satisfaction, environment satisfaction, and work-life balance on attrition.  
- **Demographics:** Age distribution and its relationship to attrition.  
- **Compensation Analysis:** Income levels among employees who left vs. those who stayed.  
- **High-Risk Profiles:** Identification of employees more likely to leave based on key factors.  


## Results

The project revealed several important insights:

- **Overtime and Low Satisfaction** are strong predictors of employee attrition.  
- Employees with **long periods without promotion** and **low job satisfaction** are at higher risk of leaving.  
- Attrition rates vary significantly across departments and job roles.  
- Early detection of high-risk employees can help reduce turnover.  

These insights can support HR departments in implementing targeted retention strategies and improving employee satisfaction.
